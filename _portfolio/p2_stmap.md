We provide a solution for Ca2+ STMap analysis comprised of an automated denoising workflow that effectively removes background image noise and enhances key Ca2+ event parameters in a fast manner. The module includes optimized tools for Ca2+ signal preprocessing and enhancement of Ca2+ signals in a variety of cell types including the Interstitial Cells of Cajal (ICC). The module can accurately detect and subtract image background noise and expeditiously remove STMap noise such as salt-and-pepper, impulsive, and periodic noise. We found that the module speed of analysis of large-datasets was substantially fast (80-90 millisecond/STMap). The automated denoising module also dramatically reduces user error opportunities and provides a consistent method for high-throughput analysis of STMap datasets.
