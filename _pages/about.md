# About Me

* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.unr.edu/cse) at [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/), advised by Professor [Alireza Tavakkoli, UNR CSE](https://www.cse.unr.edu/~alit/) & Professor [Sal Baker, UNR medicine](https://med.unr.edu/directory/sal-baker). [[Curriculum Vitae](https://sharifamit.github.io/files/Sharif_Amit_Kamran_CV_2020.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DW0hlZsAAAAJ)]
* I am expecting to complete my Masters in Computer Science & Engineering degree from University of Nevada, Reno in December 2020. 
* I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering from BRAC University, Bangladesh. My bachelor thesis was on [Exploring deep features: deeper fully convolutional neural network for image segmentation](http://dspace.bracu.ac.bd/xmlui/handle/10361/8112).
* My research interests lie in the intersection of Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Medical Image Processing. Most of my research involves Supervised and Unsupervised algorithms for Image Classification, Semantic Segmentation etc. Quite recently, I have been working on improving robustness, image synthesis and image denoising using GAN on different modalities of Opthalmological and Calcium imaging data.
