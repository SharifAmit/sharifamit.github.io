# About Me

* I'm a PhD Candidate in Computer Science & Engineering and have worked as a GRA at Human-Machine Perception Lab and Ca2+ Imaging Lab at [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/). [[CV](https://sharifamit.com/files/Sharif_Amit_Kamran_CV.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DW0hlZsAAAAJ)]

* I have worked as a Data, Analytics and Imaging Intern at Roche/Genentech from May 2022 till August 2022. Previously, I worked as a Product Development Intern at Genentech Inc. from May 2021 till December 2021.

* In December 2020,  I completed my Masters in Computer Science & Engineering from University of Nevada, Reno. My master thesis was on [Generative Adversarial Networks for Synthesizing Medical Images of Multiple Modalities](https://scholarworks.unr.edu/handle/11714/7712).

* In August 2017, I finished my Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering from BRAC University, Bangladesh. My bachelor thesis was on [Exploring deep features: deeper fully convolutional neural network for image segmentation](http://dspace.bracu.ac.bd/xmlui/handle/10361/8112).

* My research interest lies in the intersection of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Medical Image Processing. Most of my research involves Supervised and Unsupervised algorithms for Image Classification, Semantic Segmentation, etc. Quite recently, I have been working on improving robustness, image synthesis, and image denoising using Semi-supervised and Self-supervised GAN on different modalities of Ophthalmological and Calcium imaging data.
